# What is this?

This blog will serve as my personal guide and journey into **homelabbing**.

As someone who's been working in tech for over a decade, nothing frustrates me more than unclear documentation or the lack of a proper resolution path. This space is where I’ll document my thoughts, principles, and experiments as I build and maintain my homelab.

Think of this as my personal save point — something I’ll return to when I break things or forget how I fixed them.

If you happen to find anything useful here, thank you for reading — and feel free to follow along.

# What is a "Homelab"?

> *"A place for you to learn stuff, break or test things."*  
> — Some random dude on the internet.

That quote holds true, but it's vague.

A **homelab** is whatever you make of it. It could reflect your interests in cybersecurity, networking, programming, automation, gaming, or even self-hosted services.

To me, a homelab is a space where you can:
- Learn by doing
- Explore your curiosity in tech
- Be experimental and creative
- Fail safely — and recover on your own terms

It’s where you cosplay as a SysAdmin.  
It’s the **dream playground** of anyone who’s been the family’s designated "IT person."  
It’s your modern-day **man cave**, or nerd lair.

# Want to Start a Homelab? Ask Yourself:

Do you:
- Want to understand how servers actually work?
- Want to build and host your own website?
- Want to run a private Netflix-like server for family and friends?
- Want your own voice assistant like J.A.R.V.I.S.?

If yes — then just pick your poison. Don’t overthink it.

Start small. Break things. Learn along the way.

> *“What do you currently know?”*  
> *“What do you want to learn?”*

Most of us inherit the title of **“House I.T.”** at some point. But I.T. itself is a massive, ever-evolving field — one that you’ll never fully master.

Still, having a solid foundation matters.

Ask yourself:
- Do I know how the internet works?
- How does a website appear when I click a link?
- How do I play games online with friends?
- Where is my data stored? How is it delivered?
- Why do some tools or apps feel faster and better?

There’s so much more to tech than just browsers and social media.

Knowing where *you* stand helps you figure out where to start.  
Your journey won’t look exactly like mine — but feel free to tag along.

Let’s build something cool.
