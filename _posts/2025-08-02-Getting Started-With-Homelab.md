# What is this?
*This will be my personal guide / journey to **Homelabbing.*** 

As a person who’s been having fun and working in tech for over a decade now, nothing annoys me more than unclear documentation or not having a clear resolution path. Here, I will jot down ideas and principles that I will implement with my own personal tech journey.

This will serve as a guide for me to look back on when I make mistakes along the way. I'm thinking of it as my personal save state. 

If you happen to pick something up from here, you're welcome and thank you for reading.

# What is a Homelab?
*A place for you to learn stuff, break or test things.* – Some random dude on the internet.

While the statement above is true, it is quite vague. 

*A Homelab is what you make it out to be.* It is based on your personal preference, interests, needs, or even your own *philosophy*. It can tackle a wide variety of topics in IT — Cybersecurity, Networking, Programming, Gaming, and much more.

I understand that nothing is more frustrating than being thrown into a situation where you don't know where to start. It’s like starting a game without instructions on how to attack, defend, or even play.

So in short, a *Homelab*, for me personally, is a place where you learn, explore your curiosity in tech, and experiment creatively.

A place where you can cosplay as a SysAdmin — ***"The Dream"*** — the sanctuary of the family’s unofficial I.T. person. A modern-day **Man Cave**.

Now to cut the drama:

- Want to know what a server is and how it works?  
- Want to make your own website?  
- Want to host your own Netflix for friends or family?  
- Want to build your own Jarvis like Iron Man?

Just pick your poison. Don’t make it complicated.

# Tech Stack
*What do you currently know, what do you want to learn?*

You should be asking yourself that question. Where are you in your tech journey?

Lots of us are *bestowed* the title of **House I.T**. But what truly is I.T?

**I.T** is a broad profession. I'd say it could take a lifetime just to know everything that’s coming out daily. Something you learn today might be irrelevant tomorrow.

But it’s important to have a clear foundation. Ask yourself:

- Do you know how the **Internet** works?  
- How you meet your friends online? How a website works?  
- Why a game looks or feels the way it does?  
- Where and how all these data are coming from or stored?

The Internet is more than just a **browser** or social media.

Your current tech knowledge matters for knowing where to start. Your journey may be different from mine — but feel free to come along for the ride.
