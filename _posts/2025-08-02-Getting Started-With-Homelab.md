# What is this?

*This will be my personal guide and journey into **homelabbing.***

As someone who's been working in tech for over a decade, nothing annoys me more than unclear documentation or lacking a proper resolution path. This blog is where I’ll document my ideas and principles — things I implement in my own tech journey.

It’s a reference I’ll come back to when I mess something up — my personal save point.

If you happen to pick something up from here, you're welcome and thank you for reading.

# What is a "Homelab"?

> *"A place for you to learn stuff, break or test things."*  
> — Some random dude on the internet

While that statement holds truth, it's vague.

*A Homelab is what you make it out to be.* It is based on your personal preference, interest, needs, or even your own *philosophy*. It can tackle a wide variety of topics in IT — be it Cybersecurity, Networking, Programming, Gaming, and much more.

I understand that nothing is more frustrating than being shoved into a situation where you don't know where to start. It's like starting a game without instructions on how to attack, defend, or even how to play.

So in short, a **Homelab** for me personally is a place to:
- Learn by doing
- Explore your curiosity in tech
- Be experimental and creative

A place where you can cosplay as a SysAdmin.  
***"The Dream"*** of the person who’s always the family’s I.T.  
A modern-day **"man cave"** (or nerd lair).

# Want to start a Homelab? Ask yourself:

Now to cut the drama, do you:

- Want to know what a server is and how it works?  
- Want to make your own website?  
- Want to have your own Netflix-like setup to share with friends/family?  
- Want your own Jarvis, like Iron Man?

Then just pick your poison. **Don’t overthink it.**

# Tech Stack

*What do you currently know? What do you want to learn?*

Most of us get **bestowed** with the title of *"House I.T."* But what does being in "I.T." actually mean?

**I.T.** is broad.  
New tools and tech appear daily — it’s impossible to master everything. Something you learn today might be outdated tomorrow. But a solid foundation will always matter.

Start by asking yourself:

- Do you know how the internet works?  
- How do websites appear when you click a link?  
- How do you play games with your friends online?  
- Where is all this data stored?  
- Why do some apps feel faster or better than others?

The internet is more than just a browser and social media feed.

Knowing where *you* stand helps you decide where to begin.  
Your journey might look different from mine — but you’re welcome to come along for the ride.
