# What is this?
*This will be my personal guide / journey to **"Homelabbing".*** 

As a person whose been having fun and working in tech for over a decade now, nothing annoys me much more than unclear documentation or not having a clear resolution path. Here, I will jot down ideas and principles that I will implement with my own personal tech journey.

This will serve as a guide for me to look back from when I make mistakes along the way, I'm thinking of it as my personal save state. 

If you happen to pick something up from here, you're welcome and thank you for reading. :) 

# What is a "Homelab"?
*"A place for you to learn stuff, break or test things."* - Some random dude on the internet. 

While the statement above is true, it is quite vague. 

*A Homelab is what you make it out to be.* It is based on your personal preference, interest, needs or even your own *philosophy*. It can tackle wide variety of topics in IT. Be it Cybersecurity, Networking, Programming, Gaming and much more!

I understand that nothing is much more frustrating than being shoved in to a situation where you don't know where to start. It is like starting a game without instructions on how to attack, defend or basically how to play the game itself. 

So in short a "*Homelab*" for me personally, is a place where you learn, explore your curiosity in tech and possibly a place/thing where you can be experimental/creative. 

A place where you can cosplay as a SysAdmin. ***"The Dream"*** place of a person who is tasked as the family's IT. A modern day **"Man Cave".**

Now to to cut that drama, do you:

Want to know how a what's a server and how it works(Gaming, websites, etc.)? 
Want to make your own Website? 
Want to have your own Netflix to share with friends/family? 
Have your own Jarvis like Iron Man? 

Just pick your poison. Don't make it complicated. 

# Tech Stack
*What do you currently know, what do you want to learn?* 

You should be asking yourself the question above. Where are you at your current tech journey? 

Lots of us are *bestowed* *upon* the title of being the **"House I.T"**. But what truly is an IT? 

**I.T** is a broad profession. I'd say, it would even take a lifetime just to know everything that is coming out day by day as it is ever-changing. Something that you might learn here today, might be irrelevant by tomorrow. 

But it is important to have a clear foundation. So you can ask yourself this first: 

**Do you:** 
Know how the "Internet" works? 
Know how you are meeting your friends online? How a website works?
Know why a game look/feel the way it does? 
Know where and how are all these data coming or being stored? 
..etc.

Lots of topics can be covered. The Internet is more than just a "Browser" or scrolling through Social Media. 

Your current Tech Knowledge matters for you to know where to start. Your journey might be widely different than mine. But feel free to go along with the ride.
