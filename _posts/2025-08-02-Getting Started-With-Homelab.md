# What is this?

*This will be my personal guide and journey into **homelabbing.***

As someone who's been working in tech for over a decade, nothing annoys me more than unclear documentation or lacking a proper resolution path. This blog is where I’ll document my ideas and principles, the things I implement in my own tech journey.

It’s a reference I’ll come back to when I mess something up — my personal save point.

If you find anything helpful here, thank you for reading and you’re welcome to follow along.

# What is a "Homelab"?

> *"A place for you to learn stuff, break or test things."*  
> — Some random dude on the internet.

While that statement holds truth, it's vague.

*A Homelab is what you make it out to be.* It can reflect your interests — be it cybersecurity, networking, programming, gaming, or anything in between.

I know how frustrating it is to get thrown into something without knowing how to begin — like starting a game without a tutorial. No attack button, no way to defend yourself.

So to me, a **homelab** is a space where you can:
- Learn by doing
- Explore your curiosity in tech
- Be experimental and creative

It’s where you can cosplay as a SysAdmin.  
It’s the **dream** of anyone who’s become their family’s default "I.T guy."  
It’s your modern-day **man cave** (or nerd lair).

# Want to start a Homelab? Ask yourself:

- Want to know how servers work?
- Want to make your own website?
- Want your own Netflix-like setup to share with friends?
- Want a Jarvis-like system, like Iron Man?

Then just pick your poison. **Don’t overthink it.**

# Tech Stack

### *What do you currently know? What do you want to learn?*

Most of us get **bestowed** with the title of *"House I.T."* But what does being in "I.T." actually mean?

**I.T.** is broad.  
New tools and tech appear daily — it’s impossible to master everything. But having a solid foundation matters.

Start by asking:

- Do you know how the internet works?
- How do websites appear when you click a link?
- How do you play games with your friends online?
- Where is all this data stored?
- Why do some apps feel faster or better than others?

The internet is more than just a browser and social media feed.

Knowing where *you* stand helps you decide where to begin.  
Your journey might look different from mine — but you’re welcome to come along for the ride.
