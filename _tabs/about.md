### Henlo! 👋

I'm John Clifford Cariño, a tech enthusiast and an aspiring DevOps Engineer. 

By profession, I am a technical support with almost a decade of experience. Alongside that, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology as well. 

As I transition over to newer roles in the tech space, this site will serve as my public lab notebook, a place to document everything I build, break, and learn along the way.

My work spans multiple domains: from setting up reliable homelab environments and automating tasks with bash/python, to experimenting with self-hosted game/media servers, docker, virtualization, gaming consoles, and network optimization for personal and performance use.

## Why I Built This Site

This blog exists to track progress, reflect on lessons learned, and give back to the open-source and tech community. Every post represents a project, a fix, or a configuration that I’ve implemented myself-documented, so that others (and future me) can benefit.

## Want To Get In Touch?

If you have any question, suggestion, or just want to collaborate on something tech-related? Feel free to reach out via the channels at the bottom left of this page. 🙏

That's it for me. I hope you get something from my ramblings! 😁
