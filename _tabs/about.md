I'm John Clifford Cari√±o, a tech enthusiast and an aspiring DevOps Engineer. 

By profession, I am a technical support with almost a decade of experience. Alongside that, I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology as well. 

As I transition over to new roles in the tech space, this site will serve as my public lab notebook, a place to document everything I build, break, and learn along the way.

My work spans multiple domains: from setting up reliable homelab environments and automating tasks with Python, to experimenting with self-hosted game/media servers and optimizing networks for personal and performance use.

## Why I Built This Site

This blog exists to track progress, reflect on lessons learned, and give back to the open-source and tech community. Every post represents a project, a fix, or a configuration that I‚Äôve implemented myself‚Äîdocumented so that others (and future me) can benefit.
